    abstract = {The interest towards using telepresence robots in a variety of educational contexts is growing, as they have a great
 potential to enhance the educational experience of remote learners and provide support for teachers. This paper describes a study, examining the perception of Georgian university personnel about the use of telepresence robots in education. This exploratory research aimed to obtain evidence-based information on how the personnel (16 persons) from eight Georgian universities perceived the telepresence robots’ role in enhancing learning and teaching, and what challenges, benefits, opportunities, weaknesses and threats would characterise these robots. The results of the study revealed that the university personnel perceived telepresence robots to have a great potential to enhance educational activities. In addition, the participants indicated the major challenges, benefits, opportunities, weaknesses and threats, regarding integrating telepresence robotics into the teaching and learning in Georgia. Recommendations for future research are also presented.}

    abstract = {<sec>IntroductionTelepresence robots (TPRs) are the subject of an emerging field of application and research that has
    recently received attention from various disciplines. Most of the relevant research has been done in computer science, while the interest from psychology and education has been relatively modest. Proximity plays an important role in personal interactions. Although human spatial behavior has been widely studied in social psychology, little attention has been paid to the spatial behavior of humans and TPRs.</sec><sec>MethodsThe purpose of this paper is to present the results of a pilot study that investigated a certain aspect of spatial behavior – physical proximity or interpersonal distance – based on four social zones of interpersonal distance that characterize Western culture: intimate, personal, social, and public. The study conducted an experiment involving participants both in person and via TPRs, using the Double 3 TPRs in various simulated situations.</sec><sec>ResultsAccording to the findings, when interacting with a TPR, most participants maintained a communication distance of 60 to 160 cm, which is the borderline between personal and social distance, quite similar to normal human-to-human social communication. Status and previous relationship did not play any role in the choice of communication distance, but there were significant gender differences. On average, male participants chose a shorter distance to interact with TPRs compared to female participants. Persons with previous computer gaming experience chose a significantly shorter communication distance compared to persons with no such experience. A little more than half of the participants found the method of communication through TPRs to be pleasant.</sec><sec>DiscussionTPR mediated persons might be perceived as “real” when communicating with physically present persons, with similar norms applied as in human-to-human social interactions. Especially in the context of classroom communication, people keep communication distances comparable to far personal or close social distances. These findings suggest that implementation of TPRs in education does not put additional requirements for physical space in classroom.</sec>}

    abstract = {Telepresence robots (TPRs) are becoming increasingly popular in education as they support social presence (an important component of human communication) of teachers and students. This paper presents the results of a study that explored the challenges of using a telepresence robot in a higher education STEAM workshop through the eyes of a teacher, telepresence robot mediated persons and physically present students. We identified crucial aspects that need to be addressed when involving telepresence robots in the hybrid teaching and learning process. The perspectives of using TPRs were mostly positive. However, technical support and changes in classroom practices are needed for successful use of TPRs in the teaching and learning process. Although TPRs enable greater social presence, the technology is still novel and its successful implementation requires more research, focusing on applying effective pedagogical design principles and adapting the environment accordingly to the conditions necessary for the successful operation of the TPRs. The TPR’s passenger option did not yield positive results in our research. This caused the participants to become detached from what was happening in the classroom, feel unable to control the situation, and supported social presence even less than using teleconference-based distance learning methods.},

    abstract="Distance learning may lead to decreased social presence of students in higher education, potentially causing deterioration of both student learning out-comes and their mental health. Telepresence robotics is seen as an approach that, through the embodied agent of a robotic body, enhances student social presence in the classroom, improving the quality of classroom interaction. In the literature review, we analyzed the current state of research on using telepresence robots in higher education, and, based on existing papers, studied the strengths and weaknesses of using these robots in higher education. Based on our findings, we suggest that the literature in this area is scarce, requiring further studies in the future. The current telepresence robots struggle in relaying flawless telepresence experience, but can still be recommended in certain scenarios. We conclude that despite telepresence robotics being a promising technology, longitudinal studies are required to reach better understanding about the features that telepresence robots should have when used in higher education and about the best use methods.",
